    - name: Setup MSBuild
      # Installs the necessary MSBuild tools and .NET Framework targeting packs.
      # This is crucial for building older .NET Framework projects like one targeting v4.5.

    - name: Restore NuGet Packages

    - name: Build Project
      # Builds the project in Release configuration using MSBuild.
      # The /p:Configuration=Release flag sets the build configuration.
      # The /p:Platform="Any CPU" is often needed for .NET Framework projects.

      # Common paths are 'SilentXMRMiner/bin/Release/net8.0/' or similar, depending on your project structure and target framework.
